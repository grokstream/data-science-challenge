Get NASA's solar flare data here:

https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/hessidata/dbase/hessi_flare_list.txt

1. Cleanse and extract the data in a useable format for machine learning. Ideally into a database. Please use Python
2. Perform analysis on the data to find "interestingness" or correlations among the columns (if any). 
3. Perform anomaly detection on the Energy column. This column is a range of energies, it's up to you how you approach this. The timestamps for the data are also in random intervals, it's your choice how you approach this.

Caveat: Do not use Numenta's Nupic algorithms for anomaly detection (its what we use). Anything else is fine, Tensorflow, from scratch, etc. 

We are not data scientists here. This challenge is something new for us, if you come accross anything ridiculous or out of the scope of a simple challenge for hiring purposes, please let us know your thoughts they will be greatly appreciated.
